# Factorio Library

The Factorio Library is a set of high-quality, commonly-used utilities for
creating Factorio mods.

## Usage

Download the latest release from the
[mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/flib) unzip it, and put it in your
mods directory. You can access libraries provided by flib with
`require("__flib__.position")`, etc.

Add the flib directory to your language server's library. We recommend
installing the [Factorio modding
toolkit](https://github.com/justarandomgeek/vscode-factoriomod-debug) and
setting it up with the [Sumneko Lua language
server](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server) to get cross-mod
autocomplete and type checking.

You can view the online documentation
[here](https://factoriolib.github.io/flib/index.html). This documentation is
auto-generated by the Lua language server, and is heavily unpolished. It is
recommended to use language server intellisense instead of the docs site
wherever possible.
